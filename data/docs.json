The way this works is that it autogroups at runtime with an existing http server resource, and in doing so makes the path associated with this resource available when serving files. When something under the path is accessed, this is pulled from the backing http server, which makes an http client connection if needed to pull the authoritative file down, saves it locally for future use, and then returns it to the original http client caller. On a subsequent call, if the cache was not invalidated, the file doesn't need to be fetched from the network. In effect, this works as a caching http proxy. If you create this as a resource which responds to the same type of request as an http:server:file resource or any other kind of resource, it is undefined behaviour which will answer the request. The most common clash will happen if both are present at the same path. This particular implementation stores some file data in memory as a convenience instead of streaming directly to clients. This makes locking much easier, but is wasteful. If you plan on using this for huge files and on systems with low amounts of memory, you might want to optimize this.

When bitSize=32, the result still has type float64, but it will be convertible to float32 without changing its value.\nParseFloat accepts decimal and hexadecimal floating-point numbers as defined by the Go syntax for [floating-point literals]. If s is well-formed and near a valid floating-point number, ParseFloat returns the nearest floating-point number rounded using IEEE754 unbiased rounding. (Parsing a hexadecimal floating-point value only rounds when there are more bits in the hexadecimal representation than will fit in the mantissa.)\nThe errors that ParseFloat returns have concrete type *NumError and include err.Num = s.\nIf s is not syntactically well-formed, ParseFloat returns err.Err = ErrSyntax.\nIf s is syntactically well-formed but is more than 1/2 ULP away from the largest floating point number of the given size, ParseFloat returns f = ±Inf, err.Err = ErrRange.\nParseFloat recognizes the string \"NaN\", and the (possibly signed) strings \"Inf\" and \"Infinity\" as their respective special floating point values. It ignores case when matching.\n[floating-point literals]: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Floating-point_literals",

Also, for argument base 0 only, underscore characters are permitted as defined by the Go syntax for [integer literals].\nThe bitSize argument specifies the integer type that the result must fit into. Bit sizes 0, 8, 16, 32, and 64 correspond to int, int8, int16, int32, and int64. If bitSize is below 0 or above 64, an error is returned.\nThe errors that ParseInt returns have concrete type [*NumError] and include err.Num = s. If s is empty or contains invalid digits, err.Err = [ErrSyntax] and the returned value is 0; if the value corresponding to s cannot be represented by a signed integer of the given size, err.Err = [ErrRange] and the returned value is the maximum magnitude integer of the appropriate bitSize and sign.\n[integer literals]: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Integer_literals",
